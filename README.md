To design and simulate a digital filter using Verilog HDL that processes discrete-time signals to remove unwanted noise or extract specific frequency components.A Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter was implemented in Verilog. FIR filters are widely used in digital signal processing because they are inherently stable and have a linear phase response.
